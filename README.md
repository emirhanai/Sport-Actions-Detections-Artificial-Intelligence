# Sports Actions Detection Artificial Intelligence Software (CNN - Computer Vision)

---
I made artificial intelligence CNN software (Computer Vision AI Software) that detects and classifies sports movements. I trained 9 ready models and added 1 15-layer CNN Artificial Intelligence algorithm (Computer Vision Model) that I created myself to the software. In order to make the code instructive and understandable, I interpreted the code blocks with the help of notebook-like titles. I shared the dataset and software with humanity for free on Kaggle and GitHub.

I wish you pleasant artificial intelligence days...
